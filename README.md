# College Marketplace Project

Welcome to the School Marketplace project! This is a basic online platform where students can buy and sell various sanctioned items(research pending).

## Potential Features

1. **Product Listings**: Users can create listings for their handmade products, complete with descriptions, prices, and images. Each listing includes relevant details such as category, condition, and delivery options.

2. **Search and Filter**: Buyers can search for specific items using keywords or browse through categories. Filters allow users to refine their search based on price range, location, and other criteria.

3. **User Profiles**: Every user has a profile where they can manage their listings, view their purchase history, and update personal information.

4. **Messaging System(Maybe)**: Buyers and sellers can communicate directly through our messaging system. This ensures smooth transactions and allows users to ask questions about products.

5. **Secure Transactions**: We prioritize user safety. All transactions are conducted securely, and payments can be made through various methods, including PayPal and credit cards.

Features will be added/removed depending on progress and as time allows.
